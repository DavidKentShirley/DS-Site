          My name is David Shirley and I am currently a Cloud Security Data Engineer who is looking to expand into the Software Engineering field. I am currently working on a few projects such as this website. The purpose of this site is to have a centralized place for all my projects and everything that I am currently working on. I will have a roadmap of
          Current progress in projects and learning below. Feel free to check out the projects page to see what I have done and am currently working on.
